ðŸ”§ Architecture
This project is based on MVVM (Modelâ€“Viewâ€“ViewModel) architecture and follows clean architecture principles with separation of concerns.

View â†’ ViewModel â†’ UseCase â†’ Repository â†’ Model

- Jetpack Navigation is used to handle multi-page navigation and deep links.

- UseCase encapsulates business logic and improves function reusability and testability.

- Repository abstracts data sources (such as API, local DB) and provides a clean interface for domain logic.

- ViewModel manages UI state and communicates with UseCase.

- Hilt is used for Dependency Injection (DI), reducing boilerplate and improving modularity.

- Jetpack Compose builds a modern, declarative, and reactive UI layer.
